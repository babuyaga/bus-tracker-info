3.	Instrument Calibration:
The Quality Program Manager shall ensure all measuring equipment are periodically calibrated. Instrument calibration to be repeated whenever there is a reason to doubt the accuracy of the results and/or at intervals not exceeding 12 months.

4.	Production Inspection:
Production checklists have been developed for each workstation or related series of workstations. It may be necessary from time to time to amend these checklists as new corrective/preventive Actions are implemented. On each checklist, a space is provided to outline the deficiencies requiring corrective action. The checklist shall not be signed, nor the product accepted until all deficiencies listed have been corrected. All checklists stay with the product through the production sequence and are filed by the quality program personnel upon final acceptance.
There is on-line product inspection carried out by quality inspectors in each workstation in addition to that done by production crew for the purpose of checking that the tiny house segments produced conform to the drawings and specifications prepared by engineering. The quality manager will supervise and coordinate the inspection of the entire production. The checklists are to be initialed and dated by the person who completed the work and then signed by the Quality Manager or their designated personnel.

•	Workstation #7	-	Cabinet making.

5.	Methods Of Testing:

Prior to labeling and before the unit leaves the factory, the complete plumbing, gas/oil and electrical systems shall be tested on each unit produced. Testing of the heating/ventilation duct systems are to be carried out and recorded for every unit produced. Moisture check will be conducted to ensure compliance with Building Code Requirements.
All tests are conducted in designated test areas in accordance with the following test methods and fully documented in the appropriate checklist. All failures in tests are noted, the fault found and corrective action taken, are noted on the checklist. Evidence of the passing of a test is by means of the signature of the Quality Inspector.

Plumbing Tests

Every potable water system shall be subjected to, and be capable of withstanding without leakage or loss of pressure, a water or air pressure of 700 kPa for 2 hours, in accordance with the applicable Plumbing Code.    When testing with water, potable water shall be used to test a potable water system.

Every drain, waste and vent system shall be subjected to, and shall withstand without leakage, one of the following tests, as detailed in the applicable Plumbing Code:

i)	water test; or
ii)	air test;

Water pressure test shall consist in applying a water column of at least 3 m to all joints. All opening, except the highest, are tightly closed with a testing plug or screw cap. The system or section shall be kept filled with water for 15 minutes.

Air pressure test shall be conducted in accordance with the manufacture instructions. The air shall be forced into the system until the pressure reaches 35 KPa and is maintained for 15 minutes.

When a final test is made; all traps are to be filled with water, the bottom and roof terminal to be sealed and pressure equivalent of 25 mm column of water maintained for 15 minutes with out adding more air.

Gas Piping Systems

Every gas piping system shall be subjected to, and be capable of withstanding without leakage or loss of pressure, pressure testing in accordance with the applicable Gas Installation Code.

In locating leaks, the following requirements must be met:

i)	an approved liquid leak detector solution or device shall be used;
ii)	matches, candles, flames or other sources of ignition shall not be used;
iii)	artificial illumination shall be restricted to better –powered hand flashlights of the safety type or certified explosion-proof equipment; and
iv)	electric switches in or adjacent to the area of leakage shall not be operated, unless of the type designed for hazardous locations.

Electrical System Tests

The following tests shall be performed on the complete electrical assembly at the factory, as required by the applicable Electrical Code:

a)	Continuity;
Live conductors are tested for continuity by seeing that all fixtures or appliances connected to them operate correctly, and for receptacles a simple plug-in lamp is used at each receptacle to determine whether the receptacle circuit is continuous

Ground conductors, including branch circuit grounds and skin sections are tested for continuity by a battery and lamp combination or by a battery and buzzer combination, arranged so that the lamp lights or the buzzer sounds when the two leads are in electrical contact.

b)	Insulation Resistance;
Equipment used is a 500V (dc) megger tester. Criteria for passing is that under ideal conditions, the readings of the appropriate table of the Canadian Electrical Code Part I, should be obtained as a minimum.  The test is conducted as follow:

•	All circuit breakers and switches shall be in the “on” position, and all fuses are installed.
•	One tester lead is connected to the line terminals of the service entrance panel (i.e. the two line terminals are shorted together) not including the ground.
•	The other tester lead is connected to exposed metal.
•	Readings are taken after a one minute application of the test voltage.
•	If the above “per phase” test is not satisfactory, the test is repeated for each circuit.

As an alternative to the insulation resistance test specified above; an ac dielectric strength test may be performed, in which case, an ac voltage of 900 V shall be applied for 1 min (or 1080 V for 1 sec) between all live parts and non-current-carrying metal parts without breakdown occurring.

In performing either the insulation resistance or the dielectric strength test, the neutral shall be disconnected from ground for the test and be reconnected afterwards.

The polarity of all receptacles, lamp sockets and other electrical equipment shall be checked.

Moisture Check

Moisture content of lumber shall not exceed 19% at the time of installation and during construction. This is verified by a calibrated moisture meter and results recorded. A procedure is to be developed for checking and recording, it is recorded on form # (create and fill in) and are filed with each project


Air Flow Test

Airflow measurement on all supplied heating and ventilation fan(s) are done using an air flow meter accurate to within ±15% of the flow being measured and recorded for each unit. A procedure is to be developed for this testing and recording.
